    Main themes: Identify recurring topics or concerns in the responses.

    Sentiment analysis: Highlight whether the overall sentiment is positive, neutral, or negative, and provide examples of representative responses.

    Key representative opinions: Summarize the most frequently mentioned viewpoints, categorizing them based on themes like affordability, quality of care, accessibility, or staffing.

    Demographic insights: If available, correlate opinions with demographic data (e.g., age group, geographic region, income level).
